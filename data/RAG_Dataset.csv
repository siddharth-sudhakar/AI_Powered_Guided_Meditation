Focus,"Plan out your time. Start by figuring out during which times your focus is at its best. Maybe it's right after dinner or in the first hours of the day. Well, arrange your schedule so that you do the most important tasks during your most efficient hours."
Focus,"Train your brain. It's become the norm to multitask almost an autopilot without putting much thought into it.

Focus,"Sleep well, eat well. Your productivity is proven to increase, when you have slept well. Not to mention, focusing while running on an empty stomach is extra hard.

Focus,"Clear up! Once you're ready to start a new task, it's time to leave all potential distractions from your previous task behind.
