Focus,Guided Meditation,https://youtu.be/R-7RMK3aMAw?si=0ufG0MUr0jLJLNEw,10 Minutes,10 Minute Meditation,R-7RMK3aMAw,"Hello, and thank you for making 
this time for yourself today. If you're feeling a bit scattered or 
distracted or even overwhelmed right now,   then that's completely normal, 
and you're in the right place. Because over the next 10 minutes, we're going to 
take some really simple steps to gently clear your   head, refocus your attention, and help you 
feel more ready for whatever's coming next. So make yourself comfortable. You can be sitting down or 
standing up for this one,   and feel free to close your eyes 
if you like—whatever feels best. And let's begin. We'll start with a really simple 
breathing exercise that's designed   to calm your mind and help your body relax. We're going to breathe in through the nose for   a count of four and then simply 
breathe out for a count of six. Ready? Breathe in, 2, 3, 4. Breathe out, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Breathe in, 2, 3, 4. Breathe out, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Breathe in. Breathe out. Breathe in. Breathe out. Once more. Breathe in. Breathe out. Good. Now you can relax your breathing and let 
it flow naturally—there's no need to count. And as you keep breathing comfortably, 
let's gently check in with your body. Notice if there's any tension in 
your shoulders or in your jaw,   and if there is, then let them soften 
just a little bit as you breathe out. You can move them around a bit if that feels good. Stretch out your shoulders. Give your jaw a little wiggle. And feel your hands resting comfortably. Feel the weight of your hands. You can stretch out your fingers if you like. Notice your feet, firmly grounded beneath you. And just notice your whole body resting 
here, settling into this moment. Now, let's check in with your mind. How's your head feeling? Thoughts might be racing or scattered, or maybe 
they're beginning to quieten down a little bit. Whatever's going on in your 
internal world is completely fine. Just acknowledge how you're feeling right now. Everything's okay. Acknowledge whatever's there, without judgment. Just breathe. And now, I invite you to imagine that in front 
of you, there's a clean, clear workspace—a   surface or table—a beautiful, clean, clear 
workspace that's calm, organized, and ready. Begin to notice some of the details of this space. What color is this space? You can place whatever you want on that 
workspace and arrange it however you choose. Maybe there's soft, natural light. A tidy surface. Maybe a plant. Everything arranged just how you like it. It feels simple. Practical. Easy. And comfortable. This is your internal space of focus. Simplicity. Tranquility. Let yourself just rest here in this clear,   focused space, knowing that there's 
no right or wrong way to do this. You're just here, quietly visualizing a 
space that feels comfortable and clear. Picture it how you like. Change it anytime you like. And just breathe. If your mind wanders or distractions 
pop up, that's completely normal. That's just your brain braining. No worries. Just gently guide your attention back to your 
clear, uncomplicated space, where everything is... Simple. Focused. Calm. And ready. For the next few moments, just be here. Breathing easily. Rest in the quietness of this 
moment exactly as you are right now. Imagine how it might feel to 
move through your day with ease. Calmly getting things done, 
one simple step at a time. Breathe here, and enjoy this 
moment of clear, simple focus. And now, slowly, easily, bring your 
awareness back to your surroundings. When you're ready, gently blink your eyes open. Notice again the feeling 
of your feet on the ground. Maybe stretch your fingers a little. Wiggle your toes. Gently move your shoulders. Feel yourself returning naturally and easily. Take one last easy breath in... And let it out slowly. Good. And as I leave you now, I'm sending you peace. I'm sending you love. And I'm sending you happiness 
for the rest of your day.","hello, and thank you for making this time for yourself today. if you're feeling a bit scattered or distracted or even overwhelmed right now, then that's completely normal, and you're in the right place. because over the next 10 minutes, we're going to take some really simple steps to gently clear your head, refocus your attention, and help you feel more ready for whatever's coming next. so make yourself comfortable. you can be sitting down or standing up for this one, and feel free to close your eyes if you like whatever feels best. and let's begin. we'll start with a really simple breathing exercise that's designed to calm your mind and help your body relax. we're going to breathe in through the nose for a count of four and then simply breathe out for a count of six. ready? breathe in, 2, 3, 4. breathe out, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. breathe in, 2, 3, 4. breathe out, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. breathe in. breathe out. breathe in. breathe out. once more. breathe in. breathe out. good. now you can relax your breathing and let it flow naturally there's no need to count. and as you keep breathing comfortably, let's gently check in with your body. notice if there's any tension in your shoulders or in your jaw, and if there is, then let them soften just a little bit as you breathe out. you can move them around a bit if that feels good. stretch out your shoulders. give your jaw a little wiggle. and feel your hands resting comfortably. feel the weight of your hands. you can stretch out your fingers if you like. notice your feet, firmly grounded beneath you. and just notice your whole body resting here, settling into this moment. now, let's check in with your mind. how's your head feeling? thoughts might be racing or scattered, or maybe they're beginning to quieten down a little bit. whatever's going on in your internal world is completely fine. just acknowledge how you're feeling right now. everything's okay. acknowledge whatever's there, without judgment. just breathe. and now, i invite you to imagine that in front of you, there's a clean, clear workspace a surface or table a beautiful, clean, clear workspace that's calm, organized, and ready. begin to notice some of the details of this space. what color is this space? you can place whatever you want on that workspace and arrange it however you choose. maybe there's soft, natural light. a tidy surface. maybe a plant. everything arranged just how you like it. it feels simple. practical. easy. and comfortable. this is your internal space of focus. simplicity. tranquility. let yourself just rest here in this clear, focused space, knowing that there's no right or wrong way to do this. you're just here, quietly visualizing a space that feels comfortable and clear. picture it how you like. change it anytime you like. and just breathe. if your mind wanders or distractions pop up, that's completely normal. that's just your brain braining. no worries. just gently guide your attention back to your clear, uncomplicated space, where everything is. . . simple. focused. calm. and ready. for the next few moments, just be here. breathing easily. rest in the quietness of this moment exactly as you are right now. imagine how it might feel to move through your day with ease. calmly getting things done, one simple step at a time. breathe here, and enjoy this moment of clear, simple focus. and now, slowly, easily, bring your awareness back to your surroundings. when you're ready, gently blink your eyes open. notice again the feeling of your feet on the ground. maybe stretch your fingers a little. wiggle your toes. gently move your shoulders. feel yourself returning naturally and easily. take one last easy breath in. . . and let it out slowly. good. and as i leave you now, i'm sending you peace. i'm sending you love. and i'm sending you happiness for the rest of your day."

maybe noticing your belly rising and falling. And so now, just breathe however feels 
right to you—whether just observing   the breath or choosing to breathe a 
little bit deeper. It's up to you. Just take a little time now 
on your own, just to breathe. As you're sitting here, breathing in 
and breathing out, maybe you're becoming   aware of your body, your physical 
presence, tuning in to yourself. Just notice how you're feeling. Is your attention drawn to 
certain parts of your body?  Just let your mind go where it wants to. Bringing your attention now to the back 
of your body, all the way down your spine,   from the top of your head all the 
way to the base of your spine. Notice any feelings of energy or sensation there. Now, beginning to breathe all the way 
up the spine to the top of the head,   and then breathing out all the way 
back down the spine, in your own time. That breath and that energy flowing 
up the spine as you breathe in,   and the breath and the energy flowing all 
the way down the spine as you breathe out. Visualize it with your mind's eye and feel the 
energy—maybe very subtle, or maybe quite strong. Feel that flow rising up 
the spine as you breathe in,   and feel it flowing all the way 
back down as you breathe out. Do this for a little while longer, 
really tuning in to what you can feel. Good. And to complete this 10-minute meditation,   I'd like you to choose just one word to take with 
you into this day, whatever word comes to mind. Maybe peace.
Maybe acceptance.  Maybe strength.
Or maybe even love or happiness. Choose one word,   and then just begin to quietly 
repeat that word in your mind. You can say it out loud if you like, or as a 
whisper, or just hold it deep within your heart. Hear that word, see that word, and feel that word. And as I leave you now, I'm sending you peace,   I'm sending you love, and I'm sending 
you happiness for the rest of your day.","as we close our eyes, we've already begun, starting to feel the breath flowing in and out, maybe noticing your belly rising and falling. and so now, just breathe however feels right to you whether just observing the breath or choosing to breathe a little bit deeper. it's up to you. just take a little time now on your own, just to breathe. as you're sitting here, breathing in and breathing out, maybe you're becoming aware of your body, your physical presence, tuning in to yourself. just notice how you're feeling. is your attention drawn to certain parts of your body? just let your mind go where it wants to. bringing your attention now to the back of your body, all the way down your spine, from the top of your head all the way to the base of your spine. notice any feelings of energy or sensation there. now, beginning to breathe all the way up the spine to the top of the head, and then breathing out all the way back down the spine, in your own time. that breath and that energy flowing up the spine as you breathe in, and the breath and the energy flowing all the way down the spine as you breathe out. visualize it with your mind's eye and feel the energy maybe very subtle, or maybe quite strong. feel that flow rising up the spine as you breathe in, and feel it flowing all the way back down as you breathe out. do this for a little while longer, really tuning in to what you can feel. good. and to complete this 10 minute meditation, i'd like you to choose just one word to take with you into this day, whatever word comes to mind. maybe peace. maybe acceptance. maybe strength. or maybe even love or happiness. choose one word, and then just begin to quietly repeat that word in your mind. you can say it out loud if you like, or as a whisper, or just hold it deep within your heart. hear that word, see that word, and feel that word. and as i leave you now, i'm sending you peace, i'm sending you love, and i'm sending you happiness for the rest of your day."

Sleep,Guided Meditation,https://youtu.be/ZR6YxtbCM00?si=-zR9Ouz6aF5-O6Av,27 Minutes,Mindfulness Meditation,ZR6YxtbCM00,"Please make sure you are in a safe and
comfortable place where you may close your eyes relax and fall asleep while
listening. welcome to another guided meditation this guided meditation session
we'll focus on the body scan and for those of you that are unfamiliar
with the body scan we'll begin by learning how to feel our
hands from the inside let's begin by sitting down in a comfortable
position with your spine being erect make sure you were comfortable and let's take a few slow deep breaths and release any tension in our bodies especially on the shoulders and neck laying our hands gently on our lap and with one hand
tap against the other hand now please close your eyes
and for a moment feel into the hand you tabbed and if
needed tapped again several times placing your attention fully into the
hand being tapped can you feel the hand you might feel tingly or something what
you're doing now is paying attention to your hand this is what we do with each
area of the body in the body scan and we can even do that if we don't have any
sensations in that area we feel into it as if there was something to feel we like to say that numbness counts as a
sensation in this practice and now moving on to the body scan if you would like you may lie down for
the body scan we'll be practicing this for about 15 minutes you mean lay down on the floor or lay
down on a yoga mat if you like or any comfortable service if you decide to lie down it can be nice
to put your legs up on the seat of your chair it's up to you if you want to close your
eyes or just lower your gaze now that you're lying down let's find a
comfortable posture now feeling into your body lying or
sitting here you may also sit in a chair if you'd like feeling into the areas of
contact in this moment where the feet are touching the ground
or the chair the legs your back the arms the head maybe also noticing your breath entering
and leaving your body the intention of the body scan is to be
present with our body without wanting anything at all not even relaxation and
of course it's nice to relax and it's great if it happens but this is not the
goal of the body scan the goal is to be checking in with each area of the body
in a non-judgmental way we simply feel what is there to feel no need to stir up
sensations by moving the body and if your body's feeling restless wet
and shake out any tension you can try this several times to relax that part of
the body and when you're ready we can move back
into the body scan and you may notice that there are a
number of areas in the body that you might not be able to feel at all and
this is quite normal and okay just check into those areas as if you could feel
something starting with the feet feeling into both feet right now feeling into those areas where your feet
are touching the ground or the chair and maybe feeling your toes or not
whatever feels right you may also feel tingling we're some sensation like the
temperature you now moving the attention to your ankles
and lower legs hmm ask yourself what is here to feel if
anything at all feeling the pressure of your calves
against the mat or the floor perhaps the fabric against the skin and if you notice that your attention is
suddenly somewhere else gently and without judgment return it back to your
legs this is not a problem at all the mind simply likes to wander it is
important to bring it back without judgement or labeling if you find it helpful you can imagine
that you are breathing into your lower legs as if your attention could ride on
the breath or as if your attention would light up
the area as if it were a flashlight I'll letting go of the lower legs and
moving the attention to your knees and thighs what is here to feel again maybe
pressure temperature the position of your legs or nothing at all numbness does count as a sensation in
this practice noticing that thinking about an area or picturing it in your
mind's eye is different from actually feeling it now letting go of the thighs and moving
the attention to the lower trunk the pelvis and the belly up to the belly
button and noticing any sensation in this area may be feeling the breath in
the lower belly or not then letting go and now feeling into the
upper trunk the stomach area the chest feeling the sensations of the breath
here with each inhalation and each exhalation feeling the spine against the floor or
the back of the chair and noticing any sensations that are here were the
absence of sensations from here now moving the attention into
your hands and feeling your hands you might notice how well you can feel
your hands without having to see them feeling the individual finger feeling the position of your hands and when you're ready moving the
attention to the wrists and forearms now what is here to feel
touch pressure warmth now moving the attention to your elbows
and upper arms and noticing any sensations here and if your mind wanders off just
bringing it back to wherever we are just starting again and from here living the attention to
your shoulders the back of your neck and then up your head now feeling into your jaw and feeling into your face what does
your face feel like feeling your mouth knows cheeks eyes forehead and now feeling your entire face and now opening the awareness to include
the entire body again lying we're sitting here in the chair being alive
and breathing and if you like imagining to be
breathing from the crown of your head all the way down into your toes and up
and out again noticing all the sensations of the body
and allowing them to be just as they are in this moment allowing some movement back into the
body like working your fingers and toes and stretching the body in any way it
wants if it feels good and right and when you are ready in your own time
opening your eyes and coming back into a seated position let's take a moment to reflect on your
experience  and before you leave I want you to know
that you are loved.",please make sure you are in a safe and comfortable place where you may close your eyes relax and fall asleep while listening. welcome to another guided meditation this guided meditation session we'll focus on the body scan and for those of you that are unfamiliar with the body scan we'll begin by learning how to feel our hands from the inside let's begin by sitting down in a comfortable position with your spine being erect make sure you were comfortable and let's take a few slow deep breaths and release any tension in our bodies especially on the shoulders and neck laying our hands gently on our lap and with one hand tap against the other hand now please close your eyes and for a moment feel into the hand you tabbed and if needed tapped again several times placing your attention fully into the hand being tapped can you feel the hand you might feel tingly or something what you're doing now is paying attention to your hand this is what we do with each area of the body in the body scan and we can even do that if we don't have any sensations in that area we feel into it as if there was something to feel we like to say that numbness counts as a sensation in this practice and now moving on to the body scan if you would like you may lie down for the body scan we'll be practicing this for about 15 minutes you mean lay down on the floor or lay down on a yoga mat if you like or any comfortable service if you decide to lie down it can be nice to put your legs up on the seat of your chair it's up to you if you want to close your eyes or just lower your gaze now that you're lying down let's find a comfortable posture now feeling into your body lying or sitting here you may also sit in a chair if you'd like feeling into the areas of contact in this moment where the feet are touching the ground or the chair the legs your back the arms the head maybe also noticing your breath entering and leaving your body the intention of the body scan is to be present with our body without wanting anything at all not even relaxation and of course it's nice to relax and it's great if it happens but this is not the goal of the body scan the goal is to be checking in with each area of the body in a non judgmental way we simply feel what is there to feel no need to stir up sensations by moving the body and if your body's feeling restless wet and shake out any tension you can try this several times to relax that part of the body and when you're ready we can move back into the body scan and you may notice that there are a number of areas in the body that you might not be able to feel at all and this is quite normal and okay just check into those areas as if you could feel something starting with the feet feeling into both feet right now feeling into those areas where your feet are touching the ground or the chair and maybe feeling your toes or not whatever feels right you may also feel tingling we're some sensation like the

pottering along the roof and just know that sounds will anchor
you here and as you gradually go to sleep the sense will shut off but for
the moment use my voice to help guide this relaxation so we're gonna start off

falling as you breathe maybe your chest maybe your belly just observing so I'd like you now to actually start to

Sleep,Guided Meditation,https://youtu.be/F43dXoxq3CM?si=hsAzKSuFs-TlYlgm,10 Minutes,10 Minute Meditation,F43dXoxq3CM,"Welcome to your meditation to relax and 
unwind at the end of your day. So get comfortable,   and then begin by just taking some 
nice deep breaths in your own time,   breathing in through your nose and 
out through your mouth if you can. As you breathe out, relax your shoulders.
As you breathe out, relax your jaw. Let's take one more deep breath and hold your 
breath for a moment, and then breathe out,   let it go, and relax a little bit 
more. Good. You can breathe normally,   and if you haven't already, 
you can close your eyes. So, what sort of day have you had? 
Was it a good day, an easy day,   or was it a busy or a challenging day? Take a 
moment to just acknowledge the day that you've   just had. Whatever's happened—the 
big things, the little things,   the good and the not-so-good. Just 
acknowledge what's happened. The day is done, and all that's left are 
our thoughts and feelings about today,   and that's okay. Those thoughts and feelings may 
be good or not so good, but just as your breath   flows in and your breath flows out, thoughts 
of today will gradually soften and flow away. Now bring your attention to your 
body. Feel the weight of your body   pressing down on whatever you're resting on. 
And for the next part of this meditation,   we're going to pass our attention down through 
the body, simply noticing anything you feel. Begin by bringing your attention 
to the top of your head,   and pass your attention slowly down 
through your head, through your neck,   and to your shoulders. Just notice whatever 
you feel, and if you don't feel anything,   that's perfectly okay too. There's no 
right or wrong here, it's all okay. Notice your shoulders and your chest, then 
notice your arms and your hands and your fingers. What do you feel?
Maybe your hands feel a   little bit heavier now as your body relaxes 
and your mind relaxes a little bit more.   Maybe you feel certain sensations, 
or maybe not. That's all okay too. Then bring your attention to your 
belly and to your lower back,   noticing any sensations. Move your attention down through your 
hips, to your legs, and to your knees,   and slowly all the way down to your 
ankles, to your feet, and to your toes.   Just acknowledge whatever you feel. Good. Now just notice your breathing 
again. Notice when you're breathing in,   notice when you're breathing out, 
without trying to control it in any way. And now, I invite you to repeat 
these positive words after me,   in your mind or out loud, feeling 
what these words mean to you: May I be peaceful.
May I be relaxed.  May I find comfort in this moment.
May I find peace in this day.  May I rest and sleep deeply.
May I wake up refreshed tomorrow. Once more:
May I be peaceful.  May I be relaxed.  May I find comfort in this moment.
May I find peace in this day.  May I rest and sleep deeply.
May I wake up refreshed tomorrow. Good. And now just be still, 
do nothing, and simply relax. Good. And as I leave you 
now, I'm sending you peace,   I'm sending you love, and I'm sending 
you happiness for the rest of your day.","welcome to your meditation to relax and unwind at the end of your day. so get comfortable, and then begin by just taking some nice deep breaths in your own time, breathing in through your nose and out through your mouth if you can. as you breathe out, relax your shoulders. as you breathe out, relax your jaw. let's take one more deep breath and hold your breath for a moment, and then breathe out, let it go, and relax a little bit more. good. you can breathe normally, and if you haven't already, you can close your eyes. so, what sort of day have you had? was it a good day, an easy day, or was it a busy or a challenging day? take a moment to just acknowledge the day that you've just had. whatever's happened the big things, the little things, the good and the not so good. just acknowledge what's happened. the day is done, and all that's left are our thoughts and feelings about today, and that's okay. those thoughts and feelings may be good or not so good, but just as your breath flows in and your breath flows out, thoughts of today will gradually soften and flow away. now bring your attention to your body. feel the weight of your body pressing down on whatever you're resting on. and for the next part of this meditation, we're going to pass our attention down through the body, simply noticing anything you feel. begin by bringing your attention to the top of your head, and pass your attention slowly down through your head, through your neck, and to your shoulders. just notice whatever you feel, and if you don't feel anything, that's perfectly okay too. there's no right or wrong here, it's all okay. notice your shoulders and your chest, then notice your arms and your hands and your fingers. what do you feel? maybe your hands feel a little bit heavier now as your body relaxes and your mind relaxes a little bit more. maybe you feel certain sensations, or maybe not. that's all okay too. then bring your attention to your belly and to your lower back, noticing any sensations. move your attention down through your hips, to your legs, and to your knees, and slowly all the way down to your ankles, to your feet, and to your toes. just acknowledge whatever you feel. good. now just notice your breathing again. notice when you're breathing in, notice when you're breathing out, without trying to control it in any way. and now, i invite you to repeat these positive words after me, in your mind or out loud, feeling what these words mean to you: may i be peaceful. may i be relaxed. may i find comfort in this moment. may i find peace in this day. may i rest and sleep deeply. may i wake up refreshed tomorrow. once more: may i be peaceful. may i be relaxed. may i find comfort in this moment. may i find peace in this day. may i rest and sleep deeply. may i wake up refreshed tomorrow. good. and now just be still, do nothing, and simply relax. good. and as i leave you now, i'm sending you peace, i'm sending you love, and i'm sending you happiness for the rest of your day."

and more with each breath you breathe   feeling more nourished and cared for   notice how as you continue breathing and 
listening to my voice you go deeper and   deeper within yourself trust that your body 
will find the best way to let go naturally   and effortlessly you don't need to focus 
on relaxing your body will fall into   whatever state is optimum for you as you just 
continue breathing and listening to my voice it's good to know that your inner being is wise 
and all loving and is expert at healing and   balancing you in a safe peaceful and natural way 
while you just relax and flow with this experience change is a natural aspect of life 
just as one season flows into another   just as a tree lets go of its leaves the 
snow and ice of winter melt into spring   and the summer ocean waves come 
and go and come and go again   there is an ever-changing movement to 
what we see on the surface of things and now become aware of the inherent beauty 
and change feel your body relax into your   ever-changing breath one breath leading 
into another and just like the waves on the   ocean each breath has the capacity to roll 
through you cleansing and healing you now imagine now that you are breathing a cleansing 
wave of healing light up through the soles of   your feet breathing it up through your body and 
breathing it out through the top of your head breathing in through the soles of your feet 
through your body and out the top of your head   breathing in through the soles 
of your feet through your body   and the top of your head and out your fingertips you may begin to feel your body tingle or 
just feel more open receptive and alive just go with the experience knowing that any 
sensations you feel are perfect and unique to you   just relax and enjoy and receive even 
more deeply with each and every breath you'll experience a pleasant deepening sense   of comfort as you allow your 
body to relax more and more just sink now into that space feeling 
as though your body is melting like warm   butter melting into the space that you're in just 
sink in more deeply with each and every exhale and listen with a relaxed and open 
mind as i tell you a short story in 1955 the government of thailand decided to 
build a highway in bangkok through a location   where an old temple stood they purchased 
the right to the temple and agreed to let   the local monks move a centuries-old clay buddha 
to another location the clay buddha was massive   it stood more than ten feet tall and its 
belly was more than six feet in circumference   so the monks arranged for a crane to 
safely move the buddha from the old temple   to a new home and when the crane began to pick 
up and move the buddha it was clear they'd   miscalculated its fragility the idol was cracking 
immediately the temple's abbott screamed for it   to be lowered to the ground and covered with 
tarps to protect it from the incessant reigns   later that night the abbott couldn't 
sleep so he returned to the buddha   with a flashlight to inspect 
the damage to the sacred idol   as he peered at one of the cracks he noticed 
something strange deep beneath the surface   he returned to his monastery found a hammer 
and a chisel and chipped away at a small   section around the crack he was puzzled by 
what he saw so he returned to the monastery   woke the other monks and asked for help he told 
them each to bring a flashlight hammer and chisel   together they returned to the clay 
buddha and simultaneously they began   to chip away at the enormous idol they 
had been protecting for so many years   when they finished their work the next 
morning they stood back and gazed at   what together they'd uncovered their 
clay buddha wasn't clay at all instead   it was a solid gold buddha the largest known solid 
gold buddha statue in the history of the world   the golden buddha in this story is a metaphor 
for the potential that's hidden inside each of   us each of us is pure gold on the inside our 
inner being is shimmering shining perfection   often we just have to chip away at an outer layer 
of clay to get to the goal that is within us as we continue this meditation now and as 
you relax and just breathe in this very   moment the process of chiseling away layers 
of unnecessary clay that has kept you from   realizing your amazing self your inherent 
brilliance and beauty has already begun   and it will continue without you doing 
anything more just by relaxing and breathing   and listening now you are continuing the process 
of allowing your true self to emerge in every   second every minute and with every breath you are 
becoming more and more and more of your true self imagine yourself now walking 
down a path on a beautiful day   the sun is shining brightly and there's 
a slight breeze touching your skin   there's a beautiful light scent from the 
wildflowers that line your path and the air   is crystal clear and invigorating as you walk 
by yourself you feel the dirt under your feet   notice now what you see and sense the most maybe 
it's the trees or puffy clouds or bright blue sky   or birds flying by or maybe it's the warmth of 
the sun on your face or the fresh clean and high   vibrational feeling of these surroundings 
or a combination of all of these things as you look ahead you see a beautiful mountain 
before you it's calling to you and as you begin   walking towards the mountain you notice there's a 
heavy feeling on your back it's a massive weight   and you realize it's a backpack full of the 
heavy and accumulated thoughts and worries and   fears from your past and about your future these 
thoughts have hindered you they have held you   back they have weighed you down and kept you from 
inner peace and harmony from experiencing joy and   freedom this backpack is digging into your skin 
and feeling heavier and heavier with each step   but as you look up now you see the path ahead is 
illumined and calling you towards that beautiful   mountain that stands before you you walk 
towards it now carrying that heavy burden   and as you begin to walk you feel the straps 
of the backpack digging into your shoulders   even more it feels immensely heavy 
now heavier and heavier with each step   it feels so heavy as though it's filled 
with boulders and you realize now that   you've been carrying this burden for way 
too long and something within you now   a voice that's peaceful and present and wise and 
exceptionally embracing and loving tells you now   there's no need to take even one step 
further carrying this load these are   the burdens from your past they are heavy and 
weighted because they no longer serve you now   nor will they ever serve you in the days 
and months and years and decades to come   you can let go now let go of all the 
worries cares concerns resentment   and all of the unwanted stress tension anxiety 
and feelings you've been carrying with you   let go now let it all go just drop it all feel 
the weight fall off your shoulders your back   and your chest as you drop the backpack full 
of all of your past off of your shoulders feel how you feel now maybe you feel a sense of relief a sense 
of freedom lightness or something else   maybe your body's working 
through this in its own way some people feel so moved to be able to finally 
let go they shed tears or even shake a bit   the way that you experience this is perfect 
for you and it is safe to let go now now unburdened you feel more 
and more drawn to the mountain you feel more and more lighthearted and free you take one last look back at the path 
behind you and you see the backpack now begin   to dissolve right before your eyes you know the 
past with all of its heaviness and pain is over   it's time and it's possible now to start anew   looking ahead now you see the 
path before you is well lit   illumined with possibility actually and you feel 
free and unburdened and ready for new adventure   you feel filled with a sense of peaceful 
quietness that flows through you now   enveloping you permeating every cell and organ 
and system of your body you are full of light feel every molecule of your body every part of 
your mind and your entire being now healed and   whole and connected and balanced you are entirely 
aware of the deep sense of peacefulness within you just bask now in this peaceful 
awareness for a few moments of silence   as your body mind heart and spirit 
continue the process of letting go   and healing on a deep deep level in a way that is 
beyond anything you have ever known let the peace   and silence flow through your veins filling 
your heart permeating every cell of your body now enlivened you feel an inner urge to begin 
your ascent up the mountain you begin to walk   along the illumined path that's before you 
you feel sure-footed and with the likeness   of step you've never known before you feel 
inspired by this journey and it uplifts you nothing like the intensity or motivation or 
striving you felt in the past this inspiration you   feel gives you a sense of buoyancy and freedom and 
even invincibility and your every step is like an   effortless stride that's rooted in boundless 
freedom and unlimited potential and possibility   you love walking weightlessly striding 
this way on a path that's filled with light   illumined by exquisite beauty 
and boundless life at every turn all of the wildlife you encounter on 
the ground and in the skies above you   seem to feel your exhilaration and they trust 
and welcome your presence they feel your oneness   your boundless peace and the 
connectivity you feel that is so   fully alive and yet entirely 
relaxed and peaceful in this moment in what seems like just a few minutes 
of time on this timeless journey   you notice that the illumined path before you 
is now opening to a clearing and as you walk   on you find yourself entering into an even more 
brilliant light and you notice incredulously that   you are now on top of the very mountain that 
before this you could only see in the distance   you have effortlessly and miraculously summited 
the mountain having let go of that burdensome   backpack filled with all of the problems worries 
and woes of your past you are now at the top you stand looking out before you at a remarkable   360 degree vista and notice you can see 
everything with a fast and wide capacity   you see no end to the horizon as it reaches far 
beyond any sense of finiteness or limitation   you see that all the things that were so large 
and looming to you before are now so small in   the light of this bigger broader view you 
see that as you step up and out and above   it instead of being so immersed and stuck in 
it all you have a new capacity for vast vision   and immense insight and astounding creativity 
and imagination based on your new perspective you realize that whatever you experience 
in life you are bigger than that you can   easily detach from all earthly drama it's 
so small and meaningless now you soak in   this feeling of immense freedom and bask in 
this fullness now just be now in this light feel your own inner light merging 
with this light that surrounds you now you are one with all basking in the 
light of all in love with it all   you are part of something much bigger than 
yourself you are now connected to everyone   and everything feeling at one with them and at 
one with your inner strength and power all the   things that before this were not experienced as 
peaceful by you now seem to calm you and cause   you to feel compassion and an overwhelmingly 
powerful and eloquent capacity to forgive you   see and know and recognize your own beauty 
and importance in the scheme of things   you realize now without the burdens of your 
past that you came here to this life with a true   and real mission ingrained in your heart to 
love to bring joy and to forgive any and all   obstacles that could keep you from living

Anxiety and stress,Guided Meditation,https://youtu.be/-TnS_QifcPI?si=KMRnwgc91SUxZuxQ,10 Minutes,10 Minute Meditation,-TnS_QifcPI,"Hello, and how are you feeling? If you're feeling anxious or 
stressed or just a bit off today,   that's okay. Whatever brought you 
here, you're in the right place. This 10 minutes is for you, and I 
promise in just 10 minutes' time,   you're going to feel a bit better—a 
little calmer, a little more peaceful. Because we're going to slow down. We're going 
to breathe. We're going to take our time.   And we're just going to put 
everything else on hold. So begin by just getting yourself nice 
and comfortable. You can sit down,   you can lie down—whatever feels best for you. And in the first part of 
this 10-minute meditation,   we're going to work to calm 
the nervous system down a bit. And we'll do that by slowing down the breath. We'll use a simple breathing pattern. 
We'll breathe in for a count of four,   and then we'll breathe out for a count of six. Breathe in through your nose if you 
can, and out through your mouth. And the reason we make the exhale 
longer than the inhale is because   that helps to signal to the body and 
the nervous system that we're safe. And it helps to ease tension naturally. Let's give it a go. Breathe in, 2, 3, 4. Breathe out, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Again, breathe in, 2, 3, 4. 
Breathe out, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Breathe in, 2, 3, 4. Breathe out, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Breathe in, 2, 3, 4. Breathe out, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Breathe in for four. Breathe out for six. Breathe in. Breathe out. Breathe in. Breathe out. Breathe in. Breathe out. Breathe in. Breathe out. With each breath out, letting tension melt away. We're slowing everything down. Take a few more breaths just like that. Good. Now stop the counting and just let your 
breath settle into its natural rhythm. There's no need to control it anymore. And now, for the second part of 
this meditation, just be still. Breathe naturally. And as you breathe out, soften your shoulders. Relax your jaw. You can wiggle it around a little if that helps. Relax your hands. Just notice yourself resting here. If thoughts are popping up, that's okay. That's just your brain 
braining—that's what it does. But gently bring more awareness to your body. Feel the weight of your body resting here. Notice your feet. Notice your hands. Notice the temperature of the air on your skin. Still just letting the breath 
move freely as it wants to. Deep or shallow. Rough or smooth. It's all okay. Now take a moment to just tune 
into the space around you. Are there any sounds that you 
can hear, distant or close? Or is it perfectly quiet? Nothing to do. Nowhere to be. Just resting here with the breath. With the body. Just noticing whatever you find. Letting it all just be, just the way it is. Your breath flowing naturally. All is well. Let everything just be. Good. And when you're ready, maybe 
begin to wiggle your fingers. Gently stretch. And slowly blink your eyes open. How do you feel? A little more peaceful? A little more calm? Good. If you'd like to feel more calm and 
peaceful every day, try my 10x10 challenge. Just meditate with me for 10 
minutes a day for the next 10 days. And I'll put the playlist on 
screen to help you do just that. And as I leave you now, I'm sending you peace. I'm sending you love. And I'm sending you happiness 
for the rest of your day.","hello, and how are you feeling? if you're feeling anxious or stressed or just a bit off today, that's okay. whatever brought you here, you're in the right place. this 10 minutes is for you, and i promise in just 10 minutes' time, you're going to feel a bit better a little calmer, a little more peaceful. because we're going to slow down. we're going to breathe. we're going to take our time. and we're just going to put everything else on hold. so begin by just getting yourself nice and comfortable. you can sit down, you can lie down whatever feels best for you. and in the first part of this 10 minute meditation, we're going to work to calm the nervous system down a bit. and we'll do that by slowing down the breath. we'll use a simple breathing pattern. we'll breathe in for a count of four, and then we'll breathe out for a count of six. breathe in through your nose if you can, and out through your mouth. and the reason we make the exhale longer than the inhale is because that helps to signal to the body and the nervous system that we're safe. and it helps to ease tension naturally. let's give it a go. breathe in, 2, 3, 4. breathe out, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. again, breathe in, 2, 3, 4. breathe out, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. breathe in, 2, 3, 4. breathe out, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. breathe in, 2, 3, 4. breathe out, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. breathe in for four. breathe out for six. breathe in. breathe out. breathe in. breathe out. breathe in. breathe out. breathe in. breathe out. with each breath out, letting tension melt away. we're slowing everything down. take a few more breaths just like that. good. now stop the counting and just let your breath settle into its natural rhythm. there's no need to control it anymore. and now, for the second part of this meditation, just be still. breathe naturally. and as you breathe out, soften your shoulders. relax your jaw. you can wiggle it around a little if that helps. relax your hands. just notice yourself resting here. if thoughts are popping up, that's okay. that's just your brain braining that's what it does. but gently bring more awareness to your body. feel the weight of your body resting here. notice your feet. notice your hands. notice the temperature of the air on your skin. still just letting the breath move freely as it wants to. deep or shallow. rough or smooth. it's all okay. now take a moment to just tune into the space around you. are there any sounds that you can hear, distant or close? or is it perfectly quiet? nothing to do. nowhere to be. just resting here with the breath. with the body. just noticing whatever you find. letting it all just be, just the way it is. your breath flowing naturally. all is well. let everything just be. good. and when you're ready, maybe begin to wiggle your fingers. gently stretch. and slowly blink your eyes open. how do you feel? a little more peaceful? a little more calm? good. if you'd like to feel more calm and peaceful every day, try my 10x10 challenge. just meditate with me for 10 minutes a day for the next 10 days. and i'll put the playlist on screen to help you do just that. and as i leave you now, i'm sending you peace. i'm sending you love. and i'm sending you happiness for the rest of your day."
Anxiety and stress,Guided Meditation,https://youtu.be/_oTm9e3ZUUw?si=rq5ER3RApYOHf6N9,11 Minutes,BiancaMMM,_oTm9e3ZUUw,"Hello, and welcome to this guided 
meditation, we will practice a few   groundings exercises that you can USE 
anywhere for immediate anxiety relief. Life is busy, but, when stress and anxiety   occupy too much of our time, 
it can become a real problem. Leaving these feelings unchecked can even 
lead to anxiety disorders. (#1 among adults) So, let’s take a moment, sit comfortably,   with your back straight and 
your hands resting on your lap. Close your eyes and take a deep 
breath in, and slowly exhale. Bring your awareness to the present moment. 
Breathing in trust, and breathing out fear. Place your feet on the ground and focus 
on the sensations this connection brings. This simple tool aims to foster a sense of feeling 
centered, present, and grounded to the earth. Focus on your surroundings, look at your feet,   and ask yourself, where are YOU right now? 
Is everything ok right at this moment? Continue to take deep breaths in, breathing in 
belief, hold, and breathing out any uncertainty. Breathing easily and calmly, 
allowing yourself just a few moments. You can also select an object around, 
and focus your attention on it,   internally naming the colors and textures. As you practice these grounding techniques, 
you continue to bring your attention back   to your breath, inhaling deeply, 
filling your lungs with fresh air,   and slowly exhaling, letting go 
of any remaining restlessness. This is called mindful breathing, and it 
redirects your brain away from concern   by noticing the physical sensations 
of the breath in the present moment  You can let go of any apprehension, 
as in the present moment,   only happiness and peace live. Fear 
lives in the past or the future. Allow the breath to become your anchor, your 
strength, guiding you back here whenever   your mind starts to wander
As you continue to breathe,   visualize a tranquil scene. Imagine yourself in a 
peaceful garden or in a deserted beach surrounded   by beautiful flowers and gentle flowing water.
Feel the warmth of the sun on your skin and the   soft breeze brushing against your face.
Breathe in faith and confidence,  feeling the oxygen enter your belly as you hold, 
and exhale, letting go of any nervousness or  Inhale tranquility, hold, and release suffering….
You can also use a 5,4,3,2,1 exercise,   by connecting to your environment using our 5 
senses. So, going back to your tranquil scene,   name 5 things you can see, 4 things you 
can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things   you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste.
Inhale joy, hold, and release any doubt… Finding stillness within is possible, 
and you deserve to have peace.  If we notice our mind wandering during 
a meditation, we quickly return to   focusing on our breath, without any judgement,
Continue breathing, and sending the breath to   all body parts that feel tense or heavy. Release 
any remaining tightness, with a cleansing exhale.  Relax your neck, shoulder, and back.
As you relax, focus on cultivating   feelings of love, acceptance, and gratitude.
Our lives are full of blessings, and once we   seek them, we recognize how many people would 
trade their problems with ours in an instant.  Breathe in grace.
Breathe out any imbalance.  Be kind to yourself, and consistently 
practice affirmations to strengthen   your faith. You can use:
""I am worthy of love and   happiness."" – “I am grateful for what I have” – “I 
believe I am safe and protected.” – “I believe I   can get through this” - “I don’t need to know 
everything” - “I have faith that the universe   is always happening FOR all of us”
Focusing on the breath is essential. Anxiety is a normal and 
adaptive emotional response,   but with these tools, you can build 
a healthy emotional balanced life. Thinking about the evidence for 
or against your anxious thoughts   is another way to process anxiety. 
Is it real? Is it happening now?   How many times do we worry about 
things that never even happen?  And if appropriate, we can reframe the thoughts 
as a more balanced view of the situation,   moving away from unrealistic predictions.
Breathing in, hold, and breathing out.  Physical activity is also effective, as it 
diverts attention, decreases muscle tension,   changes our brain chemistry through the 
heart rate spike, and improves sleep. The adrenaline caused by our fight, flight, 
or freeze response, quickly melts away. Take another deep breath in, inhaling 
happiness and security, hold, and slowly   let go of any feelings of being STUCK.
Take a moment to notice how you   feel. Are you more relaxed? Calmer?
You can come back to this meditation   anytime, taking a few moments to 
practice these simple techniques. This way, you will be properly equipped 
when encountering a triggering situation. Remember, breath, focus, grounding, be kind 
to yourself, and have faith. You can do this.  Thank you for joining us on this anxiety 
relief meditation. May you find inner   peace and serenity.

Anxiety and stress,Guided Meditation,https://youtu.be/iLBYyjyJfuk?si=EZQ7cly_fqL9oRWA,10 Minutes,10 Minute Meditation,iLBYyjyJfuk,"Hello and welcome.
Today, we're going to take some simple but very   effective steps to reduce any stress or anxiety 
you may be feeling and to increase your sense of   peace and calm. We'll begin by using the breath 
to relax the body. Then we'll use our senses to   ground ourselves in the present moment, and we'll 
end this meditation with some very positive words. Begin by finding any comfortable position. You 
can even do this one standing up if you like.  Firstly, begin to take some deeper breaths — 
in through your nose if you can, breathing in   your own time, and making your exhale longer 
than your inhale. Slowing down your exhale. If you're experiencing any tension right now,   you might feel like you're breathing 
very high up in the body, at the top   of your lungs or even feeling it around your 
shoulders. And so, as we breathe in and out,   wherever you feel that you're breathing, begin to 
bring the breath a little lower down in the body. Feel that breath moving lower in the 
chest, down to the center of your body.   And gradually, as you feel able, bring 
that breath down, down into your belly. There's no rush. Breathing in — and breathing out. If it feels good, you might choose 
to place one hand on your belly,   feeling it begin to rise and fall as 
you breathe in and as you breathe out. Take your time. Each exhale is a chance to release, to 
let go, to soften a little bit more. Feel your body gently expanding as you breathe 
in, and feel everything relax as you breathe out. Continue like this at your own pace,   feeling the calming rhythm of your 
breath lower down in your body. Now, for the second part of this meditation,   we'll ground ourselves more in the present moment 
by noticing what's around us using our senses. If your eyes are closed, then slowly open them. 
One by one, you're going to notice three things   that you can see right now. Look around, or 
simply notice what's right in front of you. What's the first thing that you can see?
Take your time to really see that thing —   the shapes, the colours, the textures,   the way the light catches it. Look at it as 
if you're seeing it for the very first time. And then, what's the second thing you can see?  Take your time to really see that 
thing — the colours, the shapes,   the textures, the light and shade. Look 
at it as if you've never seen it before. And now, what's the third thing you can see?
Look at it with interest. See the colours,   the patterns, and shapes. 
Investigate it with your eyes. And now, you're going to bring your 
attention to two things that you can hear.  Listen carefully, and begin to focus 
on the loudest sound you can hear.   Take a moment to really hear that sound 
and to notice it, just the way it is. And then let that sound go, and focus 
instead on a quieter sound you can hear.  Maybe it's a very distant sound, or 
even the sound of your breath. Take   a moment to really hear that sound 
and notice it, just the way it is. Good. And then notice one thing that you can feel.  This could be the ground under your 
feet, the chair you're sitting on,   the fabric of your clothes against your 
skin, or the temperature of the air. Notice one thing you can feel, and allow 
yourself to really feel this sensation.   Investigate it with your mind, and 
allow it to be just the way it is. Because you are here, in this moment… 
and that's all you need to be. For the final part of this meditation, I invite 
you to repeat a few positive words after me,   either silently in your mind or out loud. Repeat after me:
I am here, in this moment.  My breath flows in, and my breath flows out.
I am here, and I am grounded.  In this moment, I have everything I need.
And in this moment, I am at peace. Once more:
I am here, in this moment.  My breath flows in, and my breath flows out.
I am here, and I am grounded.  In this moment, I have everything I need.
And in this moment, I am at peace. Good. Take your time now. Move slowly and gently, 
and take this peace and calm with you. Thank you for joining me for this
meditation. I'm sending you peace,   I'm sending you love, and I'm sending 
you happiness for the rest of your day.","hello and welcome. today, we're going to take some simple but very effective steps to reduce any stress or anxiety you may be feeling and to increase your sense of peace and calm. we'll begin by using the breath to relax the body. then we'll use our senses to ground ourselves in the present moment, and we'll end this meditation with some very positive words. begin by finding any comfortable position. you can even do this one standing up if you like. firstly, begin to take some deeper breaths in through your nose if you can, breathing in your own time, and making your exhale longer than your inhale. slowing down your exhale. if you're experiencing any tension right now, you might feel like you're breathing very high up in the body, at the top of your lungs or even feeling it around your shoulders. and so, as we breathe in and out, wherever you feel that you're breathing, begin to bring the breath a little lower down in the body. feel that breath moving lower in the chest, down to the center of your body. and gradually, as you feel able, bring that breath down, down into your belly. there's no rush. breathing in and breathing out. if it feels good, you might choose to place one hand on your belly, feeling it begin to rise and fall as you breathe in and as you breathe out. take your time. each exhale is a chance to release, to let go, to soften a little bit more. feel your body gently expanding as you breathe in, and feel everything relax as you breathe out. continue like this at your own pace, feeling the calming rhythm of your breath lower down in your body. now, for the second part of this meditation, we'll ground ourselves more in the present moment by noticing what's around us using our senses. if your eyes are closed, then slowly open them. one by one, you're going to notice three things that you can see right now. look around, or simply notice what's right in front of you. what's the first thing that you can see? take your time to really see that thing the shapes, the colours, the textures, the way the light catches it. look at it as if you're seeing it for the very first time. and then, what's the second thing you can see? take your time to really see that thing the colours, the shapes, the textures, the light and shade. look at it as if you've never seen it before. and now, what's the third thing you can see? look at it with interest. see the colours, the patterns, and shapes. investigate it with your eyes. and now, you're going to bring your attention to two things that you can hear. listen carefully, and begin to focus on the loudest sound you can hear. take a moment to really hear that sound and to notice it, just the way it is. and then let that sound go, and focus instead on a quieter sound you can hear. maybe it's a very distant sound, or even the sound of your breath. take a moment to really hear that sound and notice it, just the way it is. good. and then notice one thing that you can feel. this could be the ground under your feet, the chair you're sitting on, the fabric of your clothes against your skin, or the temperature of the air. notice one thing you can feel, and allow yourself to really feel this sensation. investigate it with your mind, and allow it to be just the way it is. because you are here, in this moment and that's all you need to be. for the final part of this meditation, i invite you to repeat a few positive words after me, either silently in your mind or out loud. repeat after me: i am here, in this moment. my breath flows in, and my breath flows out. i am here, and i am grounded. in this moment, i have everything i need. and in this moment, i am at peace. once more: i am here, in this moment. my breath flows in, and my breath flows out. i am here, and i am grounded. in this moment, i have everything i need. and in this moment, i am at peace. good. take your time now. move slowly and gently, and take this peace and calm with you. thank you for joining me for this meditation. i'm sending you peace, i'm sending you love, and i'm sending you happiness for the rest of your day."

Motivation,Guided Meditation,https://youtu.be/mFwnkUCKl4w?si=PS0SYpM0Hk3MDPrk,11 Minutes,Arthur: Ease Your Mind,mFwnkUCKl4w,"foreign [Music] hello welcome to this guided meditation building confidence and letting go of self-doubt before we begin make sure that you're in a relatively quiet space and turn off any devices that might be distracting Now please find yourself in a comfortable posture that promotes a long Natural Spine even if you're lying down set your chin in a natural position so that the back of your neck stays long drop your shoulders from your ears [Music] and soften your belly [Music] and now that you are completely comfortable gently close your eyes turning your attention awareness inward let's take a few nice deep breaths breathe in through your nose and breathe out through your nose if you notice some tension in any particular part of your body release as much as you can as you exhale breathe in filling your lungs with fresh air and breathe out letting go of any mental or physical tension [Music] let's take a few moments to practice this breathe in filling your lungs with fresh air and breathe out letting go of any tension [Music] check your mind now and let go of any mental chatter as your mind settles down your body relaxes further and as your body relaxes your mind settles down make yourself aware of any sounds around you let them come and go don't respond to them or try to push them away [Music] simply stay present practice this way for a few moments being Mindful and balance is the way to let go of unwanted thoughts and emotions without trying to push them away but simply allowing them to come and go without engaging in them without getting mentally or emotionally caught up in the narrative [Music] it is normal to feel insufficient at times everybody does but we tend to pay too much attention to those thoughts and emotions getting trapped and stuck in them so we are training to use mindfulness to awake to this recognition and to be able to observe without judgments to be able to stay present with these feelings without getting stuck in them opening the space for them to disperse at the same time we do need to make a conscious effort to look at the positive to build an our sense of confidence and strength so we can restore the balance being Mindful and letting go of self-doubt and insecurities to be able to cultivate confidence

meditation building confidence and letting go of self doubt before we begin make sure that you're in a relatively quiet space and turn off any devices that might be distracting now please find yourself in a comfortable posture that promotes a long natural spine even if you're lying down set your chin in a natural position so that the back of your neck stays long drop your shoulders from your ears and soften your belly and now that you are completely comfortable gently close your eyes turning your attention awareness inward let's take a few nice deep breaths breathe in through your nose and breathe out through your nose if you notice some tension in any particular part of your body release as much as you can as you exhale breathe in filling your lungs with fresh air and breathe out letting go of any mental or physical tension let's take a few moments to practice this breathe in filling your lungs with fresh air and breathe out letting go of any tension check your mind now and let go of any mental chatter as your mind settles down your body relaxes further and as your body relaxes your mind settles down make yourself aware of any sounds around you let them come and go don't respond to them or try to push them away simply stay present practice this way for a few moments being mindful and balance is the way to let go of unwanted thoughts and emotions without trying to push them away but simply allowing them to come and go without engaging in them without getting mentally or emotionally caught up in the narrative it is normal to feel insufficient at times everybody does but we tend to pay too much attention to those thoughts and emotions getting trapped and stuck in them so we are training to use mindfulness to awake to this recognition and to be able to observe without judgments to be able to stay present with these feelings without getting stuck in them opening the space for them to disperse at the same time we do need to make a conscious effort to look at the positive to build an our sense of confidence and strength so we can restore the balance being mindful and letting go of self doubt and insecurities to be able to cultivate confidence

Motivation,Guided Meditation,https://youtu.be/EBGaQkbSBU4?si=DK01R7ZCtWxACz5s,10 Minutes,10 Minute Meditation,EBGaQkbSBU4,"Welcome to your meditation. This time is for you—to 
reconnect with your inner strength, to grow your self-confidence, and to remind 
yourself of all that you're capable of. There are plenty of moments in life when 
we feel doubt, when things seem difficult, and our goals and dreams feel miles away from 
us. But those moments don't need to define us. So today, we're going to focus on building 
the confidence to keep on moving forward towards our goals, no matter what, because 
you're already more powerful than you know. So let's take this time to 
reconnect with that power. We'll start by calming the mind 
and getting grounded in the body as a strong foundation that we'll build upon. Sit upright with your spine relatively straight 
but nice and relaxed, and we'll begin by taking some slow deep breaths, breathing 
in through your nose if you can, feeling your belly rise, and as you 
exhale, feeling your belly fall. Breathe deep in your own time. As you breathe out, relax your shoulders. As you breathe out, relax your jaw. Feel yourself sitting here, supported by the 
ground beneath you, your body growing heavier, very present in this moment, more relaxed now. You are safe here. You are strong, your 
roots extending deep, deep down into the Earth. As you breathe, imagine those roots growing 
even deeper into the ground beneath you. Feel them spreading far and wide, 
connecting you to the Earth. These roots are strong, steady, and unbreakable. They keep you grounded, no matter 
what challenges come your way. And just like the roots of a tree, they 
support you as you grow and rise higher. With each breath in, you grow taller, 
more powerful, more confident. And with each breath out, feeling more 
connected, more grounded, and more relaxed. Now, bring your attention to any 
thoughts or feelings you might be having. Maybe you've been feeling uncertain 
or tired or a little stuck. Maybe self-doubt has been creeping in, and 
you've wondered if you should keep going. Whatever you're feeling is perfectly okay. These feelings are part of the 
journey; they are very, very normal. But they're not the whole story. So let me remind you that you are so much more 
than these moments of doubt. You are capable of more than you think. You've faced challenges before, 
and you've come through them. These challenges are all just part 
of the process. They may feel rough, but as you walk through them, they build 
strength and teach you valuable lessons. Right here, right now, you have everything 
you need to keep moving forward. Your power isn't limited, and when you 
use the power you have to move forward, more power will come to you. You don't need to have all the answers; you just 
need to take the next step, and that is enough. So let's begin to replace any 
thoughts and feelings of ""I can't"" with thoughts and feelings of ""I can."" And so, I invite you to repeat these words 
after me, either out loud, as a whisper, or silently in your mind—and 
really focus on how they feel. Are you ready? I can overcome any challenge that comes my way. I must keep moving forward, 
little by little, day by day. I will achieve all my goals and dreams 
because I am focused, and I am strong. I can overcome any challenge that comes my way. I must keep moving forward, 
little by little, day by day. I will achieve all my goals and dreams because I am capable, and I am strong. I can overcome any challenge that comes my way. I must keep moving forward, 
little by little, day by day. I will achieve all my goals and dreams 
because I am confident, and I am strong. I am confident. I am powerful. I am determined, and I am strong. I am confident. I am courageous. I am determined. I am strong. I am strong. Thank you for showing up for 
yourself today—that is powerful. And remember that confidence isn't about 
having all the answers; it's about moving forwards little by little, day by day, and 
saying to yourself: ""I can. I can. I can."" So please come back to this meditation often. Thank you for joining me for 
this meditation. As I leave you now, I'm sending 
you peace, I'm sending you love, and I'm sending you the belief that you 
can, you must, and you will succeed.","welcome to your meditation. this time is for you to reconnect with your inner strength, to grow your self confidence, and to remind yourself of all that you're capable of. there are plenty of moments in life when we feel doubt, when things seem difficult, and our goals and dreams feel miles away from us. but those moments don't need to define us. so today, we're going to focus on building the confidence to keep on moving forward towards our goals, no matter what, because you're already more powerful than you know. so let's take this time to reconnect with that power. we'll start by calming the mind and getting grounded in the body as a strong foundation that we'll build upon. sit upright with your spine relatively straight but nice and relaxed, and we'll begin by taking some slow deep breaths, breathing in through your nose if you can, feeling your belly rise, and as you exhale, feeling your belly fall. breathe deep in your own time. as you breathe out, relax your shoulders. as you breathe out, relax your jaw. feel yourself sitting here, supported by the ground beneath you, your body growing heavier, very present in this moment, more relaxed now. you are safe here. you are strong, your roots extending deep, deep down into the earth. as you breathe, imagine those roots growing even deeper into the ground beneath you. feel them spreading far and wide, connecting you to the earth. these roots are strong, steady, and unbreakable. they keep you grounded, no matter what challenges come your way. and just like the roots of a tree, they support you as you grow and rise higher. with each breath in, you grow taller, more powerful, more confident. and with each breath out, feeling more connected, more grounded, and more relaxed. now, bring your attention to any thoughts or feelings you might be having. maybe you've been feeling uncertain or tired or a little stuck. maybe self doubt has been creeping in, and you've wondered if you should keep going. whatever you're feeling is perfectly okay. these feelings are part of the journey; they are very, very normal. but they're not the whole story. so let me remind you that you are so much more than these moments of doubt. you are capable of more than you think. you've faced challenges before, and you've come through them. these challenges are all just part of the process. they may feel rough, but as you walk through them, they build strength and teach you valuable lessons. right here, right now, you have everything you need to keep moving forward. your power isn't limited, and when you use the power you have to move forward, more power will come to you. you don't need to have all the answers; you just need to take the next step, and that is enough. so let's begin to replace any thoughts and feelings of i can't with thoughts and feelings of i can. and so, i invite you to repeat these words after me, either out loud, as a whisper, or silently in your mind and really focus on how they feel. are you ready? i can overcome any challenge that comes my way. i must keep moving forward, little by little, day by day. i will achieve all my goals and dreams because i am focused, and i am strong. i can overcome any challenge that comes my way. i must keep moving forward, little by little, day by day. i will achieve all my goals and dreams because i am capable, and i am strong. i can overcome any challenge that comes my way. i must keep moving forward, little by little, day by day. i will achieve all my goals and dreams because i am confident, and i am strong. i am confident. i am powerful. i am determined, and i am strong. i am confident. i am courageous. i am determined. i am strong. i am strong. thank you for showing up for yourself today that is powerful. and remember that confidence isn't about having all the answers; it's about moving forwards little by little, day by day, and saying to yourself: i can. i can. i can. so please come back to this meditation often. thank you for joining me for this meditation. as i leave you now, i'm sending you peace, i'm sending you love, and i'm sending you the belief that you can, you must, and you will succeed."
Motivation,Guided Meditation,https://youtu.be/ccGvJmW-FIc?si=dvTA8rLFrqDjndVQ,10 Minutes,10 Minute Meditation,ccGvJmW-FIc,"Hello and welcome to your meditation to start your day more positively.  Getting yourself nice and comfortable now, 
and let's just ease into this moment together. You can close your eyes if you like. Then begin by taking a few deep breaths, 
breathing in through your nose if you can,   and breathing out through your mouth. Take nice, slow, deep, mindful breaths, 
gently filling your lungs and breathing   out through your mouth with a long and slow 
exhale, in your own time, in your own rhythm. With every exhale, allowing the 
body to relax a little bit more,   noticing any tension you're holding 
and letting it soften with each exhale. Please take your time; there's no need to rush. On your next inhale, as you fill your 
lungs, hold your breath comfortably for   a moment with your lungs full, before 
again breathing out with a long exhale. Do that a couple more times—filling your lungs,   holding your breath just for a moment 
before that really long, slow exhale. Being very aware of your breathing, 
settling into this place and this   time as this new day begins, feeling 
very present, a little more grounded. Good, and now you can just breathe normally. 
Don't try to control your breath in any way;   let your breath flow in its own natural rhythm. As we start this new day, how are you feeling?
Just waking up,   or is your mind already busy 
with thoughts of the day ahead? However you're feeling is perfectly okay.  What you're experiencing right now is uniquely 
yours, and it's all okay, and it's all allowed. At the start of this day, what 
do you see in this day? What   do you see stretching ahead of you?
Is it a busy day or is it a quiet day? Do your thoughts of today fill you with pleasure?
Do your thoughts of today feel uncomfortable? The truth is, we can never be sure exactly 
what's coming. At the beginning of every day,   the future is unknown and not 
something we can fully control. But what we can do is create some 
positive thoughts, to begin to   choose our thoughts—thoughts about the day ahead. And so, I invite you to repeat 
the following words after me,   in your mind or out loud, to help create 
some positive thoughts and some positive   feelings about the day ahead—to get 
the day off to a really good start. Let's begin: Thank you for this day. Thank you for the people I will meet. Thank you for the conversations I will have. Thank you for the positive energy that 
surrounds me now and throughout this day. Thank you for the good surprises 
that are coming my way. Thank you for the pleasures. Thank you for the satisfaction I will feel. Thank you that today will be smooth. Thank you that today will be easier 
than I could ever have imagined. Thank you that today will be filled   with successes—be they small 
successes or big successes. Every success is more positive 
energy, and I'm grateful for that. Thank you for the opportunities 
that will come my way today. I welcome them with open arms, 
ready to embrace whatever comes,   knowing that each opportunity is a step forward. May this day be filled with peace. May this day be filled with happiness. Let's repeat those one more time: Thank you for this day. Thank you for the people I will meet. Thank you for the conversations I will have. Thank you for the positive energy that 
surrounds me now and throughout this day. Thank you for the good surprises 
that are coming my way. Thank you for the pleasures. Thank you for the satisfaction I will feel. Thank you that today will be smooth. Thank you that today will be easier 
than I could ever have imagined. Thank you that today will be filled   with successes—be they small 
successes or big successes. Every success is more positive 
energy, and I'm grateful for that. Thank you for the opportunities 
that will come my way today. I welcome them with open arms, 
ready to embrace whatever comes,   knowing that each opportunity is a step forward. May this day be filled with peace, and 
may this day be filled with happiness. Good. Carry this sense of calm and positivity with you.  It's always here for you, ready

Forgiveness,Guided Meditation,https://youtu.be/YUHOhfEC0bk?si=hzsLFri7fk62af4f,5 Minutes,Brain Education TV,YUHOhfEC0bk,"Today I will share with you about “Forgiving the Unforgivable.” I am sure
if you are living on this planet Earth and you have this physical body,
you have your fair share of feeling “I cannot forgive this person, ever.” And when you think about the person
or situation, you feel so emotional. It can be anger coming up and hard to really control or think straight. Have you had that kind of experience? Before you can know 
how to forgive, I want to share with you
about why you cannot forgive. Number one, feeling is so strong
that you are living in the past in the present moment.
Even if you have so much opportunity and a chance to meet new opportunity,
new people, you cannot see it, you cannot feel it,
you cannot sense it. Also, because you feel 
so much hurt from before you become victim of the situations,
victim of that person who hurt you.
From the victim place of consciousness, you have decided or decided
to accept the idea and the viewpoint to see other people
a certain way. So this we call preconceptions. We call this also filter. So looking through the filters or
shade of glasses, you begin to see things. One more thing is that you create ego certain characteristics or some identity.
You have your truest nature of yourself, which is love and courage and trusting
and freedom all of that. But begin to cover that true self
the ego of yours will begin to act, feel, and see certain way. That means you don't have the opportunity
to express your true self anymore. And in that way you may feel that
your life is stuck. So do you think you want to keep this way or you want to overcome it
and be able to let go or forgive? Absolutely let go and forgive. Now I want to share with you
how to be able to forgive. First, accepting the law of nature. When you see nature, 
everything is in balance already. So that means what comes in, 
will go out. What comes in, you keep it, and it creates blockage and even pain
because it's not natural. If you continue to create same thoughts and won't be able to release
or let go of those painful memories and you keep holding onto it,
then what happens? It creates imbalance in your body
and you feel pain. Next step is being in the present moment.
Being the present moment means being able to detach
from what you are so much attached to. When you are hurt you are in a way
deeply attached to that experience and the painful memories.
I want to say that detachment and conscious observer that means that you are able to feel it
without numbing yourself. Next,
I want you to know that if you cannot take response ability for your healing,
you cannot heal. I am able to watch, observe, know why I feel continuously in pain,
what I'm holding on to, and be able to take responsibility of being able to let go of it yourself. I can make that choice to let go
or hold onto it. Next, at some point
of letting go or accepting process, you are able to shift from this victim
or emotional state to your truest nature. You can call it true self
or your beautiful soul. You are able to sense that
in the deepest place inside of you. So I hope this sharing
helped you to see yes, I can change. And there are things
that I can do to change and to eventually forgive yourself
and other people. Thank you, see you soon!","today i will share with you about forgiving the unforgivable. i am sure if you are living on this planet earth and you have this physical body, you have your fair share of feeling i cannot forgive this person, ever. and when you think about the person or situation, you feel so emotional. it can be anger coming up and hard to really control or think straight. have you had that kind of experience? before you can know how to forgive, i want to share with you about why you cannot forgive. number one, feeling is so strong that you are living in the past in the present moment. even if you have so much opportunity and a chance to meet new opportunity, new people, you cannot see it, you cannot feel it, you cannot sense it. also, because you feel so much hurt from before you become victim of the situations, victim of that person who hurt you. from the victim place of consciousness, you have decided or decided to accept the idea and the viewpoint to see other people a certain way. so this we call preconceptions. we call this also filter. so looking through the filters or shade of glasses, you begin to see things. one more thing is that you create ego certain characteristics or some identity. you have your truest nature of yourself, which is love and courage and trusting and freedom all of that. but begin to cover that true self the ego of yours will begin to act, feel, and see certain way. that means you don't have the opportunity to express your true self anymore. and in that way you may feel that your life is stuck. so do you think you want to keep this way or you want to overcome it and be able to let go or forgive? absolutely let go and forgive. now i want to share with you how to be able to forgive. first, accepting the law of nature. when you see nature, everything is in balance already. so that means what comes in, will go out. what comes in, you keep it, and it creates blockage and even pain because it's not natural. if you continue to create same thoughts and won't be able to release or let go of those painful memories and you keep holding onto it, then what happens? it creates imbalance in your body and you feel pain. next step is being in the present moment. being the present moment means being able to detach from what you are so much attached to. when you are hurt you are in a way deeply attached to that experience and the painful memories. i want to say that detachment and conscious observer that means that you are able to feel it without numbing yourself. next, i want you to know that if you cannot take response ability for your healing, you cannot heal. i am able to watch, observe, know why i feel continuously in pain, what i'm holding on to, and be able to take responsibility of being able to let go of it yourself. i can make that choice to let go or hold onto it. next, at some point of letting go or accepting process, you are able to shift from this victim or emotional state to your truest nature. you can call it true self or your beautiful soul. you are able to sense that in the deepest place inside of you. so i hope this sharing helped you to see yes, i can change. and there are things that i can do to change and to eventually forgive yourself and other people. thank you, see you soon!"
Forgiveness,Guided Meditation,https://youtu.be/DYtgRQVJ_1k?si=ruXf1I2EcTArjPFU,33 Minutes,Mark Vletter,DYtgRQVJ_1k,"Help yourself settle down, get comfortable, find a posture that has a feeling of support in it for you. Sitting, standing, walking or lying down. Let yourself become present. Here and now. I suggest that you take a few breaths that are fuller than usual. And if you prefer not to focus on your breath, which is perfectly fine, you might prefer to focus on a feeling like gratitude or an image like a mountain lake or the ocean or a word. Such as peace. I'll talk about the breath, though. So a few deliberately, slightly bigger breaths. If you like, in through your nose and mouth. Through your mouth. And then with your eyes open or closed. Stay aware of breathing. Or if you prefer, simply be aware of a different part of your body, such as the sensations in your hands or your feet, or the sense of the room that you're in otherwise. Stay in touch with a feeling of breathing. Continue to know that your breathing. As a kind of experiment, see what it's like to be rested in the breath, letting go of all else. No. When you are breathing in and no. And you are breathing out. Be aware of various sensations related to breathing. And be aware of little changes and those sensations. Like taking a deeper or a shallower breath. Or the breath becoming increasingly light and soft. Give over to the breath, letting go of all else. Be aware of the whole body of breath, aware of your chest as a whole, as you breathe. And then gradually whitening awareness. To include sensations in the whole body as you breathe. A single whole body of breath. Be aware of your body as a whole as you breathe. And then continued to stay aware of breathing. With or without a sense of your body as a whole. And while staying aware of breathing, also be aware of a sense of opening or widening or spaciousness in the field of awareness. And explore the combination. Of ongoing mindfulness of breathing. In an open, wide, spacious field of awareness. If your attention contracts around anything, let that go. Let that dissolve into the openness. The whiteness. Of awareness. Staying with it. Given over to the present. In touch with the body. Awareness. Open and wide and spacious. With her growing mingling of heart fullness. Simple sounds of heart opening. With spacious awareness. Grounded in the body. Becoming increasingly absorbed in the sense of this. Artfulness. Spaciousness. Groundedness. Gently establishing herself. In artfulness, spaciousness and groundedness. And I'll be quiet for the rest of the meditation.","help yourself settle down, get comfortable, find a posture that has a feeling of support in it for you. sitting, standing, walking or lying down. let yourself become present. here and now. i suggest that you take a few breaths that are fuller than usual. and if you prefer not to focus on your breath, which is perfectly fine, you might prefer to focus on a feeling like gratitude or an image like a mountain lake or the ocean or a word. such as peace. i'll talk about the breath, though. so a few deliberately, slightly bigger breaths. if you like, in through your nose and mouth. through your mouth. and then with your eyes open or closed. stay aware of breathing. or if you prefer, simply be aware of a different part of your body, such as the sensations in your hands or your feet, or the sense of the room that you're in otherwise. stay in touch with a feeling of breathing. continue to know that your breathing. as a kind of experiment, see what it's like to be rested in the breath, letting go of all else. no. when you are breathing in and no. and you are breathing out. be aware of various sensations related to breathing. and be aware of little changes and those sensations. like taking a deeper or a shallower breath. or the breath becoming increasingly light and soft. give over to the breath, letting go of all else. be aware of the whole body of breath, aware of your chest as a whole, as you breathe. and then gradually whitening awareness. to include sensations in the whole body as you breathe. a single whole body of breath. be aware of your body as a whole as you breathe. and then continued to stay aware of breathing. with or without a sense of your body as a whole. and while staying aware of breathing, also be aware of a sense of opening or widening or spaciousness in the field of awareness. and explore the combination. of ongoing mindfulness of breathing. in an open, wide, spacious field of awareness. if your attention contracts around anything, let that go. let that dissolve into the openness. the whiteness. of awareness. staying with it. given over to the present. in touch with the body. awareness. open and wide and spacious. with her growing mingling of heart fullness. simple sounds of heart opening. with spacious awareness. grounded in the body. becoming increasingly absorbed in the sense of this. artfulness. spaciousness. groundedness. gently establishing herself. in artfulness, spaciousness and groundedness. and i'll be quiet for the rest of the meditation."

inner child take a nice deep breath and close your eyes take another deep breath and allow your body to completely relax let your attention move to your toes and allow them to go completely limp now relax your instep your heels and your ankles just let the whole foot become heavy allow this relaxation to move up your calves and into your knees continue to move this warmth and relaxation into your thighs feeling them become heavier now let your hips and your buttocks melt your waistline releases [Music] and you can feel the peacefulness move up into your chest expanding through your collarbone and into the shoulders now allow your upper arms to let go your elbows relax your lower arms wrists and hands and the last of the tension moves out through your fingertips let your neck relax your jaw [Music] your cheeks all the muscles around your eyes you're for it and your scalp let go let go let go relax many of us have an inner child who is lost and lonely and feel so rejected perhaps the only contact we have had with our inner child for a long time is to scold it and criticize it then we wonder why we are unhappy let us do some work to connect with those neglected inner parts of ourselves go back with me in time see yourself as a little child of five hold out your arms and say to this child I am your future and I have come to love you embrace this child lovingly and then bring this child with you to present time see the two of you standing in front of a mirror looking at each other lovingly and as you stand there you become aware that there are so many parts of you that are missing so once again let us go back in time to the very moment you were born you had just come out of the birth canal it may have been a difficult trip you feel the cold air and the bright lights and someone may have just smacked you you have arrived you are here to live a whole lifetime love that little tiny baby love that baby [Music] now move forward in time to the moment when you began to walk you would stand up and fall down and stand up and fall down and stand up and fall down and then suddenly you were standing and you took a step and another step and you were walking and you were so proud of yourself love that little child love that child then move forward in time to your first stay at school you didn't want to leave your mother and you knew you had to go and you didn't want to leave your mother and you went you took your first steps over the threshold you were scared but you did it you were doing the very best you could and love that child loved that child [Music] then remember your life around the age of 10 and all the stuff that was going on then it may have been wonderful it may have been difficult and you were doing the very best you could to survive and you made it so loved that child just loved that child then go to the time you were just entering puberty and all that was going on it was exciting and scary and maybe more than you could handle but you got through it you did the best you could and you made it so loved that teenager loved that teenager go to the time of your first job and how exciting it was to earn money you wanted so badly to make a good impression and there was so much to learn and you did the best you could and love that person just love that person remember the time you were first rejected in love and how much your heart hurt and you wanted to die and then you were afraid you wouldn't and you knew that no one would ever love you again you were in such pain and you did the best you could and you made it love that person loved that person then go to another milestone in your life it may have been embarrassing or painful or wonderful whatever it was you were doing the best you could at that time with the understanding knowledge and awareness that you had them so loved that person loved that person now gather all the many parts of yourself and bring all of them forward in time to present time see yourself standing in front of the mirror with all of yourselves and realize that you are looking at the richness and fullness of your life of course there were difficult times and painful times and embarrassing times and times of confusion and that's alright it's part of life love all of yourself now all of you turn around and as you look ahead you see a person standing before you with arms outstretched saying I am your future and I have come to love you when it feels right come back to the room life is an endless opportunity to love ourselves past present and in the future loving and accepting every part of ourselves is healing how can we possibly be whole or healed if we are rejecting any parts of ourselves healing is to make ourselves whole again love yourself every part of yourself and be whole all is well and so it is [Music] we hear over and over again how important it is to love ourselves we are aware that love is the most powerful healing force there is and yet no matter how hard we try to love ourselves many of us keep hitting a brick wall something is in the way it seems impossible for us to break through we began to believe that we just can't love who we are that there must be something wrong with us or perhaps we are not worth loving this frustration and anger at our own inability to do what we know is so important to us leads to depression we feel hopeless and yet there is an answer there is something we can do to open the most stubborn doorway to love we can forgive forgiveness opens the doorway to love so that love may flow most abundantly in our life I have noticed that when the door to love seems to be stuck it is usually because there is someone or something that we are unwilling to forgive yes it may be true that we have had a very unpleasant experience in our past that is unfortunate however it is not unforgivable forgiveness is a gift to ourselves for it sets us free when we refuse to forgive we sit in a prison of self-righteous resentment and stay stuck in the past this hurts only ourselves the other person may not even know we are in pain I know that you can heal your heart now and that you are worth loving here is something we can do to change things let's take a little journey to clean out the pockets of bitterness that may still reside in you close your eyes and let's walk down into a valley going down is always symbolic of going into your subconscious mind to do clearing work as you descend into this valley you notice with delight how very beautiful it is lush and green flowers everywhere birds and butterflies trees and a gentle stream find a comfortable place to sit on the bank of this stream settle down and just relax it is so peaceful and safe here it's a wonderful place for letting go for forgiving ask yourself what is the hardest thing to forgive [Music] remember the pain that incident caused you where are you carrying it in your body how long have you been carrying that pain [Music] in this very safe place allow yourself to take the pain out of your body and hold it in your hands look at it from every angle how big is it what color is it does it have a sound a smell a taste do you really want to keep it any longer [Music] are you willing to let it go now gently place it in the stream watch the current dissolve it and take it away all that hurt and suffering is being dispersed made harmless as it drifts away feel the water flowing against your hand washing it clean notice how glad you are to have released that old junk now take another incident really relive it feel the pain and hurt take a breath and step back in your mind and look at the incident from the other person's point of view does it look the same from that angle [Music] now take another breath and look at the same situation from an observers point of view someone who is watching both of you and is totally objective is that also another point of view every time you look at the experience from a different angle you get a different reaction who is right and who is wrong is anyone really right or wrong now take that whole incident involving the other party you the incident and the observer and let them all gently submerge into the stream dissolving and disappearing let it go let it go until it is gone from sight and from your emotional grasp give yourself a moment of peace on the bank of the river lay back against the grass and breathe [Music] who is the hardest person to forgive and why [Music] if you really wanted to forgive this person you know you could what is it you want to hold on to would you rather be right or would you rather be happy perhaps you have held this pain long enough and now it is safe enough for you to let it go what would you be willing to give in return for releasing this negativity could you give understanding for abandonment could you now give compassion for the old abuse and betrayal could you give acceptance for rejection could you just forgive and let go are you willing to change your old beliefs of I am worth abusing too I am worth cherishing how willing are you to give up these old ideas for a new freedom that forgiveness can bring you once again just release all of this pain drop all of this bitterness into the river let the person go release them set them free say to them I forgive you I forgive you for not being the way I wanted you to be I forgive you and I sent you free let the whole experience go wash yourself free of every vestige of the past see blocks and barriers drifting down the stream watch them go they have no part of you anymore you are cleansed and you are free now go through your mind and find any other places were unforgiveness resides take each incident or person and hold them in your hands and look at them and decide if you are willing to be totally free now I forgive you and I set you free I [Music] forgive you and I set myself free now place each one in the river and see them dissolve as they drift downstream let them go let it all go forgive and release the whole world now step into the stream yourself let yourself be totally immersed for an instant then stand up in the water and declare for yourself I am forgiven I am forgiven and I am free your mind your heart your whole body is being cleansed of all negative debris the weight has been taken away you can see it floating downstream never to return what a relief what a joy as you come back up the bank notice how light and free you feel the sunshine looks brighter and dries you instantly the colors and the sounds are more vivid the world is more beautiful and you know you are entitled to miracles what miracle would you like now see it clearly in your mind something wonderful you would like to have happen in your life know that it is possible as you walk up out of the valley having left the old patterns behind feel the space opening in your heart feel the love beginning to flow there is nothing to stop it now you feel so peaceful so relaxed so alive so willing to love so very free you have forgiven you have been forgiven life looks good and you know that all is well in your world and so it is [Music]","hey

move forward in time to the moment when you began to walk you would stand up and fall down and stand up and fall down and stand up and fall down and then suddenly you were standing and you took a step and another step and you were walking and you were so proud of yourself love that little child love that child then move forward in time to your first stay at school you didn't want to leave your mother and you knew you had to go and you didn't want to leave your mother and you went you took your first steps over the threshold you were scared but you did it you were doing the very best you could and love that child loved that child then remember your life around the age of 10 and all the stuff that was going on then it may have been wonderful it may have been difficult and you were doing the very best you could to survive and you made it so loved that child just loved that child then go to the time you were just entering puberty and all that was going on it was exciting and scary and maybe more than you could handle but you got through it you did the best you could and you made it so loved that teenager loved that teenager go to the time of your first job and how exciting it was to earn money you wanted so badly to make a good impression and there was so much to learn and you did the best you could and love that person just love that person remember the time you were first rejected in love and how much your heart hurt and you wanted to die and then you were afraid you wouldn't and you knew that no one would ever love you again you were in such pain and you did the best you could and you made it love that person loved that person then go to another milestone in your life it may have been embarrassing or painful or wonderful whatever it was you were doing the best you could at that time with the understanding knowledge and awareness that you had them so loved that person loved that person now gather all the many parts of yourself and bring all of them forward in time to present time see yourself standing in front of the mirror with all of yourselves and realize that you are looking at the richness and fullness of your life of course there were difficult times and painful times and embarrassing times and times of confusion and that's alright it's part of life love all of yourself now all of you turn around and as you look ahead you see a person standing before you with arms outstretched saying i am your future and i have come to love you when it feels right come back to the room life is an endless opportunity to love ourselves past present and in the future loving and accepting every part of ourselves is healing how can we possibly be whole or healed if we are rejecting any parts of ourselves healing is to make ourselves whole again love yourself every part of yourself and be whole all is well and so it is we hear over and over again how important it is to love ourselves we are aware that love is the most powerful healing force there is and yet no matter how hard we try to love ourselves many of us keep hitting a brick wall something is in the way it seems impossible for us to break through we began to believe that we just can't love who we are that there must be something wrong with us or perhaps we are not worth loving this frustration and anger at our own inability to do what we know is so important to us leads to depression we feel hopeless and yet there is an answer there is something we can do to open the most stubborn doorway to love we can forgive forgiveness opens the doorway to love so that love may flow most abundantly in our life i have noticed that when the door to love seems to be stuck it is usually because there is someone or something that we are unwilling to forgive yes it may be true that we have had a very unpleasant experience in our past that is unfortunate however it is not unforgivable forgiveness is a gift to ourselves for it sets us free when we refuse to forgive we sit in a prison of self righteous resentment and stay stuck in the past this hurts only ourselves the other person may not even know we are in pain i know that you can heal your heart now and that you are worth loving here is something we can do to change things let's take a little journey to clean out the pockets of bitterness that may still reside in you close your eyes and let's walk down into a valley going down is always symbolic of going into your subconscious mind to do clearing work as you descend into this valley you notice with delight how very beautiful it is lush and green flowers everywhere birds and butterflies trees and a gentle stream find a comfortable place to sit on the bank of this stream settle down and just relax it is so peaceful and safe here it's a wonderful place for letting go for forgiving ask yourself what is the hardest thing to forgive remember the pain that incident caused you where are you carrying it in your body how long have you been carrying that pain in this very safe place allow yourself to take the pain out of your body and hold it in your hands look at it from every angle how big is it what color is it does it have a sound a smell a taste do you really want to keep it any longer are you willing to let it go now gently place it in the stream watch the current dissolve it and take it away all that hurt and suffering is being dispersed made harmless as it drifts away feel the water flowing against your hand washing it clean notice how glad you are to have released that old junk now take another incident really relive it feel the pain and hurt take a breath and step back in your mind and look at the incident from the other person's point of view does it look the same from that angle now take another breath and look at the same situation from an observers point of view someone who is watching both of you and is totally objective is that also another point of view every time you look at the experience from a different angle you get a different reaction who is right and who is wrong is anyone really right or wrong now take that whole incident involving the other party you the incident and the observer and let them all gently submerge into the stream dissolving and disappearing let it go let it go until it is gone from sight and from your emotional grasp give yourself a moment of peace on the bank of the river lay back against the grass and breathe who is the hardest person to forgive and why if you really wanted to forgive this person you know you could what is it you want to hold on to would you rather be right or would you rather be happy perhaps you have held this pain long enough and now it is safe enough for you to let it go what would you be willing to give in return for releasing this negativity could you give understanding for abandonment could you now give compassion for the old abuse and betrayal could you give acceptance for rejection could you just forgive and let go are you willing to change your old beliefs of i am worth abusing too i am worth cherishing how willing are you to give up these old ideas for a new freedom that forgiveness can bring you once again just release all of this pain drop all of this bitterness into the river let the person go release them set them free say to them i forgive you i forgive you for not being the way i wanted you to be i forgive you and i sent you free let the whole experience go wash yourself free of every vestige of the past see blocks and barriers drifting down the stream watch them go they have no part of you anymore you are cleansed and you are free now go through your mind and find any other places were unforgiveness resides take each incident or person and hold them in your hands and look at them and decide if you are willing to be totally free now i forgive you and i set you free i forgive you and i set myself free now place each one in the river and see them dissolve as they drift downstream let them go let it all go forgive and release the whole world now step into the stream yourself let yourself be totally immersed for an instant then stand up in the water and declare for yourself i am forgiven i am forgiven and i am free your mind your heart your whole body is being cleansed of all negative debris the weight has been taken away you can see it floating downstream never to return what a relief what a joy as you come back up the bank notice how light and free you feel the sunshine looks brighter and dries you instantly the colors and the sounds are more vivid the world is more beautiful and you know you are entitled to miracles what miracle would you like now see it clearly in your mind something wonderful you would like to have happen in your life know that it is possible as you walk up out of the valley having left the old patterns behind feel the space opening in your heart feel the love beginning to flow there is nothing to stop it now you feel so peaceful so relaxed so alive so willing to love so very free you have forgiven you have been forgiven life looks good and you know that all is well in your world and so it is"

reminding you that you are alive that you are still moving forward 
that you have so much more ahead of you let gratitude fill you not for the failures

struggled who didn't have all the answers send them love tell them you did your best and that was enough let this warmth expand within you you are whole even with your past mistakes you are worthy even with your imperfections you are ready to step forward
