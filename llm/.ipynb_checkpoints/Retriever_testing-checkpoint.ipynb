      "until you find yourself sinking. It feels heavy but it feels familiar. You may find yourself\n",
      "scared of fading, and wanting to disappear again. So, how do you keep going? Here are five ways to stay motivated, once you're ready to do something. 1. Realize what you can control, and allow the rest\n",
      "that you can't to just be. It's powerful when you recognize that you're in control of\n",
      "how your life unfolds. This prevents you from living passively. We all feel lost\n",
      "at some point in our lives, and that's okay. But when you allow\n",
      "your uncertainty to do the steering, you can easily fall into the trap\n",
      "of going through everyday motions, just because. It's easy to give ourselves\n",
      "less credit than what we deserve, because it means taking less\n",
      "responsibility for our lives. Instead of shutting yourself away\n",
      "from taking control, embrace it. But also learn to let go\n",
      "of what cannot be controlled. Balance is key. Have people in your life\n",
      "who believe in your potential, although it may be tempting to want to prove\n",
      "your non-believers wrong. You may be putting yourself\n",
      "at an emotional risk. If you're going to be motivated, be motivated by healthy reasons. Do something because you care about. Or, if you're feeling dejected, do something because you\n",
      "want to care about it again. Connect with positive people\n",
      "and others with similar goals, together, we can build\n",
      "a support system for one another when the going gets tough. Everyone falls down at some point. What matters is finding others\n",
      "who can lend a hand to help you get back up\n",
      "and try again. 3. Adapt a different perspective\n",
      "towards your obstacles. Don't be afraid of\n",
      "your struggles or challenges. Instead, build your resilience and focus on the benefits of growing\n",
      "from the mistakes you make. Setbacks can teach you\n",
      "the art of patience. It's easy to get discouraged when you experience bad days\n",
      "or feel overwhelmed, with things get hectic. Life is full of surprises,\n",
      "including the bad ones. So, expect the unexpected, but don't allow the temporary negativity to cause you prolonged suffering. Instead, take a step back, and tell yourself that\n",
      "the storm will pass. 4. Breakdown your big goals\n",
      "into smaller ones. It can be daunting\n",
      "when you have to execute big tasks. Rather than diving in blindly, It's more helpful to first visualize\n",
      "what you want to accomplish. You can do this by drawing a map, creating an outline\n",
      "or coming up with a list. When you break down a big task\n",
      "into multiple small ones, it makes it much more approachable\n",
      "and much more doable. Since there's only\n",
      "24 hours in a day, and only so much energy you carry, before you feel burnt out\n",
      "and need to recharge. You have to recognize\n",
      "the limitations you possess, and make the best\n",
      "out of your time and resources. This will help you learn\n",
      "how to prioritize accordingly. 5. Don't forget to live for yourself, and have fun in between. If all you're doing\n",
      "is work and no fun, Then, you're putting your mental\n",
      "and physical health at risk. Don't forget to enjoy life\n",
      "for what it is. Although it's great to find something\n",
      "you're passionate about, leave room for yourself, to grow with your friends,\n",
      "your love life and your family. Break familiar cycles of work and routine and replace them with laughter\n",
      "or moments of joy when you try something new. Give yourself time to be who you are, without your work defining you. It doesn't make you\n",
      "any less passionate. You just make room\n",
      "for valuable experiences that remind you why\n",
